I have included a small .txt file called password.txt, this includes around 700 random words that can be used as an example for passwords for testing.

This program is designed to work with a .txt file that contains single lines of passwords as shown in the passwords.txt file.

THE CHECK PASSWORD BUTTON
The user can enter a password, Once the user presses the Check Password button, the program will check the .txt file for a match. results may vary depending on users computer.

The .txt file path can be replaced and changed within the main.py code.

THE FETCH RANDOM LINES BUTTON
The "Fetch Random Lines" button, will return a maximum of 1000 lines taken from a random area of the .txt file that the user has supplied (#Remember to add the file path to .txt file around line 24, this is so the program knows where to scan the .txt file that contains all the words).

These returned results can be viewed in the display window.

The user can enter a password in the window provided and the program will check the supplied .txt file to see if it is conatined within the file.
